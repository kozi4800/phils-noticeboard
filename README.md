Welcome to the Notice Board!
The Notice Board is a fun way to share messages, announcements, or roleplay notes with other players in the game! You can post notices, read what others have shared, and manage your own messages, all from anywhere in the game world.
What is the Notice Board?
Think of the Notice Board as a virtual bulletin board where you can pin up messages for everyone to see. Want to announce a town meeting, offer a job, or post a wanted poster? Just use the /noticeboard command to get started!
How to Use the Notice Board
Here’s how you can jump in and start using the Notice Board:
1. Open the Notice Board

Type /noticeboard in the chat, anywhere in the game.
A menu will pop up with two options: Post New Notice and View Notices.

2. Post a New Notice

Choose Post New Notice from the menu.
Fill in:
Title: A short headline for your notice (up to 50 characters).
Description: The main message (up to 500 characters). Write something clear or creative!


Click OK to post it. You’ll get a “Notice posted successfully” message if it worked.
Note: You can only have up to 3 notices at a time. If you hit the limit, delete an old one first.

3. View Notices

Choose View Notices to see all messages on the board.
Each notice shows:
The title and message.
Who posted it (their character’s first and last name).
When it was posted.


If you posted a notice, you can click it to manage it.

4. Delete Your Notices

Click one of your notices in the View Notices menu.
You’ll see two options:
Delete Notice: Removes that specific notice forever.
Delete All Notices: Removes all your notices at once.


For either option, you’ll be asked to confirm by clicking Confirm in a pop-up. This prevents accidental deletions!
After deleting, you’ll see “Notice deleted successfully” or “All your notices have been deleted successfully.”

Notice Limits

You can have up to 3 notices posted at a time. This keeps the board fair for everyone.
If you try to post a 4th notice, you’ll get a message: “You have reached the maximum number of notices (3).”
To post a new notice, delete one or all of your existing ones first.

Tips for Players

Keep it Short: Titles should be snappy, and descriptions should get to the point.
Roleplay Fun: Use the board for in-character messages, like event invites, bounties, or shop ads.
Check Often: New notices appear all the time, so visit the board to stay updated.
Manage Your Notices: Delete old notices to make room for new ones and keep the board fresh.

If Something Doesn’t Work

Can’t post a notice? Make sure you filled in both the title and description, and check if you’ve hit the 3-notice limit.
Menu not opening? Try typing /noticeboard again or ask a friend if it’s working for them.
Still stuck? Contact a server admin for help. They can check if the Notice Board is set up correctly.

Have fun sharing your messages and connecting with other players on the Notice Board!
